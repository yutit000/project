    <h1>The final HTML project.</h1>
    <p>This final project will be about the school.The school I go to is Lynnwood high school.I really like this school and the people in it.
  I made a few friends already in the first few days of school,a few juniors and a few seniors too.I also like the sportsmanship in the school teams.
  The people I have played sports with for the team have helped me and new people to get used to the system.LHS is a very good school.
  The teachers in the school is also very helpful, if you need help on math or other subjects the would gladly help you after or during school.The shcool website will be
