<body>This final project will be about the school.The school I go to is Lynnwood high school.I really like this school and the people in it.
  I made a few friends already in the first few days of school,a few juniors and a few seniors too.I also like the sportsmanship in the school teams.
  The people I have played sports with for the team have helped me and new people to get used to the system.LHS is a very good school.
